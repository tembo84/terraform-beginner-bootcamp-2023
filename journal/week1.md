# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defines required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file (with a filename ending in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json) and then specify that file on the command line with -var-file.
eg: `terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"`

### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

Terraform also automatically loads a number of variable definitions files if they are present:

Files named exactly terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json.
Any files with names ending in .auto.tfvars or .auto.tfvars.json.

### order of terraform variables

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

Environment variables
The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)

## Dealing With Configuration Drift

The Terraform state file is a record of all resources Terraform manages. You should not make manual changes to resources controlled by Terraform, because the state file will be out of sync, or "drift," from the real infrastructure. If your state and configuration do not match your infrastructure, Terraform will attempt to reconcile your infrastructure, which may unintentionally destroy or recreate resources.

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run Terraform plan is with attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift
